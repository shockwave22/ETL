# ETL

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a flexible data mart that integrates sales data from the three divisions of the product company (TPC-W, TPC-E and PEC). This data mart will allow the company to optimize its financial performance by monitoring sales, quantity sold, costs and profits. This Data warehouse will allow analysis and reporting at different levels like customer, product, supplier, quarter and year among others. This will also serve as a standard, integrated and reliable data source for the enterprise to support analysis and decision making needs.
